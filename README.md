# Calculator
Java calculator app
uses imported scanner and stack
stack is a modification of an array list that easily allows you to remove and add the first and last items int he array, I used this to get pemdas order of operations inside of the calculator
the final keyword makes the string immutable so the operations stay the same
pop removes the last element fromt he stacka array
